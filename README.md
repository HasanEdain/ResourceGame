A simple turn based board game.
A mix of checkers (8x8 board, simple moves) with resource gathering.

Rules:
Players start with 10 of each resource
Players start with 1 S1 piece on their home square

Turn: Move a piece, or purchase a piece (added to the player’s home square). No “passing”
A piece can move
		S: the number of square horizontaly or verticaly
		D: 1 Square diagonally any direction

A piece that spends a turn on a square gathers 5 resources of that type
A piece that spends a turn on it’s home square transfers it’s resources to the player’s pool
A piece that spends a turn on it’s opponent’s home square takes one of each available resource
If a player’s home square is occupied by the opponent, the player can not purchase a piece
A piece can be purchased for 10x it’s number of moves in money
A piece consumes one food and one water per turn from the players pool (each negative removes one random piece)

Any piece moved on to an occupied square takes the piece

First player with 0 pieces looses
First player with 50 money at the end of both move wins
